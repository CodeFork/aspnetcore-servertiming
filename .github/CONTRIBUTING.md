## Getting Started

We're so glad that you're thinking about contributing! It's quite simple:

1. Fork the repository and make your changes, or just edit a file in this repository using the Edit button on GitHub if the change is simple enough.
1. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/metalface-oss/aspnetcore-servertiming/pull/new/master).

If you're unsure about anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.
